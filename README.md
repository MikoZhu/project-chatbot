This project is aim to create  functional chatBot interface using JavaScript,HTML and CSS. I've also added a sound for the chatBot when user's answer pop up on the screen. 

## The problem
At the begnning, I was struggling with how to get the value when I use the addEventListner. Afterwards, I've googled how to use the addEventListner. There is really good resource that I've found. Here is the link: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_addeventlistener.asp. Also, I had a favicon problem when I change the svg fomart img. The Error message shows:  the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found). The solution is 
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="">
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="#">, this is From Chrome 2020.
